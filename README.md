# ParanthesesChecker
 This code is expected to read the text in a text file line by line, checking  the parentheses used. If all brackets in the stack matched, they need to suppress the message  "Parenthesis are matched", and if the parentheses do not match, they need to suppress the message  "Parenthesis do not matched."
